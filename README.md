# üìà Stock Price Prediction Web App

![Banner](static/banner.png)

A **Flask-based web application** that predicts stock prices using a **Deep Learning model** (LSTM) and visualizes the stock trends with **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**. It also allows users to **download stock data** as CSV.

---

## üéØ Features

* Predict future stock prices using a trained LSTM model.
* Visualize **closing prices** with 20, 50, 100, and 200 days EMAs.
* Compare **predicted vs actual stock prices** in a chart.
* Download historical stock dataset in CSV format.
* Supports **all stocks listed in Yahoo Finance**.
* Interactive and easy-to-use **web interface**.

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction-app.git
cd stock-prediction-app
```

2. **Create virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> `requirements.txt` should include:
>
> ```
> Flask
> pandas
> numpy
> matplotlib
> yfinance
> keras
> tensorflow
> scikit-learn
> ```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Enter a stock ticker in the web form (default: `POWERGRID.NS`).
2. The app fetches historical data from **Yahoo Finance**.
3. EMAs are calculated for **20, 50, 100, 200 days**.
4. Data is scaled and fed into the **LSTM model** to predict stock prices.
5. Charts and CSV download link are generated dynamically.
